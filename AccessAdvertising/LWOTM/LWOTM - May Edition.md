Hi, I’m Liam. I’m one of Access’s Front End Developers. Once a month I’m going to show you the weirdest, funniest, smartest websites I’ve come across and put them all in one place for your consumption. We all need a rest from work occasionally, and these sites are a great way to take a brain break. If you’ve got any sites that you’d like to share then I’d love to hear about them @accessdigital - the weirder the better. But for now, disappear down the rabbit hole with me; it’s going to be a trip.
