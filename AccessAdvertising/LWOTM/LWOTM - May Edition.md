Hello once again everyone! Another month means that a whole new host of lovely websites have been collated for your browsing blues. We'll once again dive into the world of the web from beautiful modern designs to the downright crazy and fun! Buckle up.

1. [Session Japan](http://sessionjapan.com/)
![https://placehold.it/350x150](Session Japan homepage)
Session Japan is a small company that create fully guided and unique tours around Japan. They only take small groups to be able to deliver a more personal and intimate excursion for all involved. Their website is a shining example of what can be done with minimal design on the web. Everything from the elegant typography to the colour pallete is carefully thought through and the subtle asian influences really ties the website to the subject matter. A beauty to behold.

2. [Taking a line for a walk](http://williamngan.github.io/line/)

[https://twitter.com/williamngan](William Ngan) was inspired by one of his [https://medium.com/@williamngan/taking-a-line-for-a-walk-6fd947acb227#.59de0nnpp](favourite artists attempt) at creating his signature art through an iPad rather than traditional materials to create something that could change how lines are drawn on a digital canvas to form a different approach to digital drawing. This website showcases that if you think outside the box and question the way things are normally done then we can get better results.

3. [Statamic](https://statamic.com/)
![https://placehold.it/350x150](Statamic homepage)
Statamic is a flat-file CMS built on the widely popular PHP framework Laravel (specifically Laravel 5.1). The developers at Statamic have developed a CMS that doesn't rely on a database to store website content and instead stored as content files. Quite a revolution in terms of thinking but what's just as good is the website that sells the product is filled with just as much love, fun and attention to detail as it's shipping product! The [https://docs.statamic.com/guides](documentation) illustrates this excellently. Couple their unique copy writing style with a elegant and modern web design and it's ticking all the boxes.

4. [Powerpuff Yourself](https://www.powerpuffyourself.com/#!/en)
![https://placehold.it/350x150](Powerpuff Yourself homepage)
This entry was unique in the list because it was chosen from this [https://twitter.com/LiamWalshWeb/status/720891895292014593](Twitter poll) because I simply couldn't make my mind up on what I loved more, Powerpuff Girls or Pokemon! The winner in the end was Powerpuff Yourself.
