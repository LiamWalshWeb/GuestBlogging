![LWOTM Logo](../../LWOTM-logo-beard.jpg)

Buna ziua boys anf girls, ladies and gentlemen!!! LWOTM is here again and he's whizzed up some pst Halloween treats! Or could they be tricks? Let's find out, maybe keep the lights swithced on ðŸ˜‚

1.[ Hilary vs Trump](https://worldwide.vote/hillary-vs-trump/#/)

![Hilary vs Trump homepage](hilary-vs-trump.jpg)

With the American candidacy race heating up to over 9000, soon there will be a winner. But before the USA makes it's final decision this website allows people from other countries to cast a vote and logs results to show what the rest of the world is thinking. It makes great use of animation without being over-the-top and also balances the colours and has a interesting layout structure. Some technical goodies behind the scenes detect the language and/or the location of the user.

2.[ Pottermore Patronus](https://my.pottermore.com/patronus)

![Pottermore Patronus homepage](pottermore-patronus.jpg)

Pottermore's Patronus section is great example of bringing the theme of a book/movie/franchise into the web format, sparing no expense in technical prowess and using suitable technologies in order to create the best experience possible. This web piece is a magical experience and should be awarded all the points!!! Making use of WebGL and animation, using fairly minimal colour palette in the best way keeps everything looking coherent. Hogwarts wanna-be-attendee can learn what their Patronus would be if magic was real ðŸ˜­  #TrytNotToCry #MagicIsReal!!!

3.[ Windows93.net](http://www.windows93.net/)

![Windows93.net homepage](windows93-net.jpg)

A playful throwback to Windows 93 this website recreates it's subject matter almost perfectly and has a lot of homage to it's original OS. Very performant despit the very busy interface coupled with some fancy Javascript going on behind the curtains and is an example, once again, of the different experiences can be made on the web.

4.[ Luca Restaurant](http://luca.restaurant/)

![Luca Restaurant homepage](luca-restaurant.jpg)

Making my tummy grumble something fierce! Luca Restaurant combines beautifully a rich and varied colour palette with some great choices of typography to really set the scene. You can tell what this website entails and who it might belong to before even reading any copy. They also throw out all the modern website cliches and produce a layout and content structure that makes sense for the user as they journey through the site. Bringing great identity and individuality to the fore they make something that can be distinguished and creates a stylish and classy medium to reflect the business.

Get your bibs ready for drooling at the food menu and website.

5.[ Sharkle](http://sharkle.com/)

![Sharkle homepage](sharkle.jpg)
