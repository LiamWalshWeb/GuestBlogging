Space Advisor combines a very ambitious desktop experience featuring 3D, animation, sound and incredible graphics with a mobile experience that connects to the desktop browser and allows you to play mini games etc from your phone! Black magic I hear you cry? No it's all thanks to the power of WebGl and WebSockets used in very creative ways. Anybody wanting to know how to push the limits of today's web tech should definitely check this out.

The new beginning of a new season of football has ushered a very different Premier League this year for England and with that they also have a ravamped website. This webiste is a great example of how to relay tabular data and large amounts of information without cluttering the interface too much and manages to be responsive and work excellently on various devices.

4.[ Donald Trump Colouring Book](http://obliterate.me/)

The next winner goes to Donald Trump Colouring Book, a website which is a colouring book for mature adults who appreciate the incredible lunacy and childlike nature of Donald Trump. No matter if you're a lover or hater of America's least qualified presidential candidate everyone can find some joy in scribbling and graffitiing a politician. Maybe tweet us some of your best scribbles into [@accessdigital](https://twitter.com/accessdigital/) using the hashtag [#LWOTM and #DonaldDoodles](https://twitter.com/home?status=%23LWOTM%20%23DonaldDoodles)?

5.[ Foxy Casino - The Secrets of Magic Revealed](https://www.foxycasino.com/featured/secrets-of-magic.html)

The final winner of the month harkens back to 1980's action films and video games in terms of it's style and presentation. What I love about Foxy Casino's The Secrets of Magic Revealed is the colour pallete as it transports you to the era of origin. There is good use of animation and typography to complement the 1980's feel of the website. A great website for those looking for a piece of the past created in a modern way.
