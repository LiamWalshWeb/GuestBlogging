November 8th 2016... the date a lot of people have been counting down to... the presidential race to the White House will be over and the world will once again know peace on social media... until the next bunch of Donald Trump quotes come in.

Aloha one and all to a special Presidential Edition of LWOTM in which I have created the biggest listing of LWOTW's for any one blog post. It's been hard to limit the list to just 11 due to the shear number of websites and micro-sites that have popped up due to this historical presidential race. There have been so many things to talk about round this election and people have sprung at the opportunity to create some buzz around the race. Bucckle up chaps it's gonna be a humdinger! üò±

1.[ Hire the Donald](http://hirethedonald.com/)

![Hire the Donald homepage](hire-the-donald.jpg)

Possibly the best website on this list details mockingly all of Donald Trump's qualifications to be president. Fueling people to vote for Hilary Clinton highlighting the crazed business mans credentials and quotes. Pulling content from genuine sources is impressive and there are some cute interactive elements such as the endorsement section which moves positive actions when you try to click them üòÇ definitely worth a look.

2.[ Clinton and Trump Said...](http://clintonandtrumpsaid.com/)

Trying to find that infamous quote from Donald or just want to know what Hilary thinks about gun control? This website searches Youtube videos from both candidates and find quotes from speeches about the search criteria. Useful for all those times Donald says "I didn't say that!" Yes Donald you did, you definitely did.

3.[ Pussy Grabber](http://pussygrabber.com/)

![Pussy Grabber homepage](pussy-grabber.jpg)

Those easily offended might jump and squirm at the title of this website but fear not, the premise of this website is to grabd as many cats as possible in a time limit. Obviously playing off of the infamous quote from the vile viral video this website is nothing to fear, just bad humour.

4.[ The Donald Test](http://thedonaldtest.com/)

![The Donald Test homepage](the-donald-test.jpg)

Ever wondered who you sounded more like, Hilary or Donald? Neither have I! üòÇ But with this website they can analyse your Twitter profile tweets to see who you sound like. Those who'd rather not have the ugly truth reveiled enter at your own risk, here be dragons and all üê≤

5.[ And the next President is](http://andthepresidentis.com/)
