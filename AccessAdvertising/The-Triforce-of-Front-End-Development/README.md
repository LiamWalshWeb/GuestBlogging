The Triforce of Front End Development
=========

A long, long time ago the World was in an age of Chaos. In the middle of this chaos, on a little website in the realm of The Interent, a legend was being handed down from generation to generation, the legend of the 'Triforce'; three front end tools possessing mystical powers.

A lot of the best modern web developers in the world started off in an era that was witnessing the birth of the internet. The likes of Jeffery Zeldman, `TODO: add more names here` people who are a great influence in the industry and also helped make the web what it is today. I remember reading the blogs and article's that these legends produced and remember the struggles that early web development endured. Long winded and unmanageable CSS files, bloated and unmanageable HTML code and inconsistent Javascript code... that was also unmanageable.

I was born during this time but did not experience the internet till much later in its lifespan in the late 2000's. Joining at a age where the web was going through a transition of which it had never been through before. Responsive web design, preprocessors, code standards, CSS3 and HTML5, these were my first experiences with web development.
