My First Drupal Camp - Bristol 2016
===================================

For most of the development team here at Access this years visit to Drupal Camp Bristol was just another Drupal Camp for their attendance tally, for me however this would be the first Drupal Camp and Drupal related event I would ever attend! My name is [Liam Walsh](https://twitter.com/LiamWalshWeb) and I'm a front end developer at Access and I'm the one in the picture below that's second from the right.

I have attended conferences before for various things but despite working at Access for more than 2 years now I had somehow avoided going to any Drupal Camps. A few reasons including; not feeling I would enjoy the event as much as someone else on the team and volunteering to stay behind, not being sure of what such an event would be like (would I be out of my knowledge depth? Feel uncomfortable amongst such well established Drupal vets?) and sometimes just because I would rather stay in my comfort zone rather than challenge my developer social skills.

## The Departure

So we set off on the road on the Friday afternoon to stay overnight and be ready nice and early to attend the event. The drive down was a warm one, it was either all the windows down or full blast air conditioning to try and keep the devs CPUs cool!

## The Camp Saturday Morning

The morning kicked off with a talk from one of the organisers of the event about contributing to Drupal and open source projects and was joined by a man who was doing his first talk at a Drupal Camp who had experienced the similar issues as we all do when we first set out to start giving back to the community. He talked about the reserach he and conducted at a company to try and understand why more people using open source and Drupal didn't feel like and or couldn't give back to that which most of them made their living off.

This was a great first talk to open the day with, especially for myself being a newcomer and have though about trying to contribute to Drupal before but never quite knowing how, why or when to do so. They're talk was very well spoken and also very relatble and had the attendtion of everyone in the room.

We then had a short break for beverages before we went to witness the one-man-band himself and Access' own [Ashley Johnson](https://twitter.com/johnnnnson) present his talk on his Project Management Toolbox.

Ash talked about all the lovely tools that we use here at Access to try and make our professional life easier and more efficient so that we can be the best that we can.

We then broke up for lunch that was lovingly put together by the event hosts so that all could stay and not have to rush finding lunch elsewhere. After lunch
