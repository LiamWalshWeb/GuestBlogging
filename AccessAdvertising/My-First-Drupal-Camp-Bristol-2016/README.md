My First Drupal Camp - Bristol 2016
===================================

For most of the development team here at Access this years visit to Drupal Camp Bristol was just another Drupal Camp for their attendance tally, for me however this would be the first Drupal Camp and Drupal related event I would ever attend! My name is [Liam Walsh](https://twitter.com/LiamWalshWeb) and I'm a front end developer at Access and I'm the one in the picture below that's second from the right.

I have attended conferences before for various things but despite working at Access for more than 2 years now I had somehow avoided going to any Drupal Camps. A few reasons including; not feeling I would enjoy the event as much as someone else on the team and volunteering to stay behind, not being sure of what such an event would be like (would I be out of my knowledge depth? Feel uncomfortable amongst such well established Drupal vets?) and sometimes just because I would rather stay in my comfort zone rather than challenege myself.
